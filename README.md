#Pattern Lab Node Grunt Dependency Example

This repository is a reference example of a fully configured parent project that uses [Pattern Lab Node](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node) as a dependency. `node_modules` are not included out of sanity, but running `npm install` from this cloned repository will show that it is indeed a dependency along with everything else.

Making Pattern Lab Node a dependency allows you to host your source and public patterns and assets outside of the module, making upgrades easier.

Documentation that attained this state can be found [here](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Running-Pattern-Lab-Node-as-an-NPM-Dependency).
